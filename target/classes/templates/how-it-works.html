<h2>How it works!</h2>
<p>We don’t have a shelter, so in order to meet a pet one on one, please fill out the adoption application by clicking the link below. Once we’ve received your application and it is approved, we will contact you to discuss the pet you’re choosing to adopt and set up a time for you to meet them.</p>

<p>We do NOT adopt dogs on a “first come, first served” basis, but rather make every attempt to match families with the most compatible pets.</p>

<p>The customary adoption fee for pets is $150 for dogs and $200 for medical dogs. These fees help to defray the costs of spaying/neutering, testing, vaccinating, and micro-chipping our pets, but rarely, if ever, cover all expenses. Therefore, additional contributions are welcomed. Adoption fees and donations are NOT refundable. Our dogs are heartworm tested and placed on heartworm preventative.</p>
